# CRUD Applications: Contacts App & Notes App

This repository contains two simple full-stack CRUD applications — a **Contacts Manager** and a **Notes App** — built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). These projects were developed as part of an internship program to demonstrate core CRUD functionality.

- **Frontend**: React, Bootstrap (optional)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (via Mongoose)
- **API Format**: REST

## Both the apps have a similar backend code since both of them are based on CRUD operations, I reused the code written for contacts app, for the NotesApp too.
