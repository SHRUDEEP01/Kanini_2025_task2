# CRUD Applications: Contacts App & Notes App

This repository contains two simple full-stack CRUD applications — a **Contacts Manager** and a **Notes App** — built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). These projects were developed as part of an internship program to demonstrate core CRUD functionality.

## 📁 Project Structure

bash
/contacts-app
  /client   # React frontend
  /server   # Node + Express backend

/notes-app
  /client   # React frontend
  /server   # Node + Express backend


## Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/SHRUDEEP01/Kanini_2025_task2.git
cd Kanini_2025_task2

## For Contacts app:

->To run the Frontend:
cd contacts
npm install
npm start

->To run the Backend:
cd contacts
cd backend
nodemon index.js

## For the Notes app:

->To run the Frontend:
cd NotesApp
npm install
npm run dev

->To run the Backend:
cd NotesApp
cd backend
nodemon index.js

## Both the apps have a similar backend code since both of them are based on CRUD operations, I reused the code written for contacts app, for the NotesApp too.
